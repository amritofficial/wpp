# WPP

# About
The project is entirely made in JavaScript with no hard coded text and tags (other than the basic structure of divs). The project consists of two html files - ``cbc.html`` & ``stream.html``. The ``cbc.html`` consists of the main challenge. The page contains
three different links and loads up a video on the page whenever any button is clicked. Alongside the video player, there are three buttons -
``Play``, ``Pause`` and ``Stop`` for easy controls. 
The second page consists of an optional challenge for a live video stream. The page uses ``hls.js``, a third-party library to play a live stream 
from the link provided.

# Setup
The project is simple to run and doesn't contain any server side code. Just simply run the ``cbc.html``.
